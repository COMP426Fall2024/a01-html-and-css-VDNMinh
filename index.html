    <p class="para-j">The oarfish is one of the most fascinating fish in the ocean. Like, look at this thing:</p>
    <img class="imgDefault" src="https://www.divescotty.com/images/pictures/blog/giant-oarfish/320/oarfish-sea-serpent_320.jpg" alt="no image">
    <p class="para-j">The common oarfish that we DO get to encounter reaches lengths at about 3 meters (I refuse to use feet).
        However, there's a reason I said that in a weird way, because most oarfish we encounter are juveniles that gets washed ashore.
        In fact, adult oarfishes have been reported to reach a whopping 11 meters, which had Guinness (fraudulent as they are) registered it
        as the longest fish in existence.

    <p class="para-j">This, alongside the fact that oarfish sightings are incredibly rare due to their preferred depths reaching a full kilometer under the surface,
        led many to believe that oarfishes are the origin of many sea serpents in folklores.</p>

    <p class="para-j">A myth I'm particularly fond of is how oarfishes can predict earthquakes, because they actually can, in a sense.
        Due to their unique property of being a mainly deep-dwelling species that remains unharmed upon heading to the surface, oarfish sightings
        usually indicate tremors from near the sea bed. Other sea creatures with this property, such as the sperm whale, rises much more often
        than this elusive silver noodle, and doesn't serve as as good an indicator. There have been some studies debunking this, but my very few
        remaining bits of childhood whimsy that hasn't been drowned out by college led me to believe that it's true.
